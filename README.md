## PETT Plant Android App
This is an Android app designed to control a [PETT Plant LED sculpture](http://biotronesis.com/store/) via Bluetooth.

With the app, you can:

* Connect to a Plant via Bluetooth
* Select the Entrainment Mode
* Start, Stop and Loop Entrainment sequences 
* Select the Color Mode
* Set the Color Mode speed
* Start, Stop and Pause the Color Mode

One of the Color modes is Sound Responsive. Here is a [PETT Plant](https://vimeo.com/129860490) in that mode, enjoying some Bobby McFerrin.

The Plant is powered by the awesome [Teensy microcontroller](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/), and is mentioned on their website [here](https://www.pjrc.com/pett-plant/).

## From the Settings/Help screen
#### Entrainment Mode
To start a brain wave entrainment cycle, select the desired sequence from the Entrainment Mode drop down list and tap the Run button to begin. Tap the Stop button to stop the current entrainment cycle and return the cycle to the beginning.
     
#### Color Mode
To select the color pattern that your PETT will display, select one from the Color Mode drop down list. Use the Speed slider to adjust the rate at which the colors change. The Pause button will freeze the colors at any given point. Tap the Resume button again to resume the animation.

#### Hint
The brain wave entrainment mode will run with several of the available color patterns. For the best results in maximizing the stroboscopic effect, we recommend choosing 
one of the first 3 Rainbow cycle patterns that turn all of the LEDs on full bright, and placing your PETT in a fully darkened room.

Enjoy!
